# The Collection

Scapes are 10,000 unique pixel landscapes on Ethereum. Each is algorithmically composed from 107 traits with multiple hidden variations, producing a wide range of environments — cities, forests, deserts, oceans, and everything in between.

## Onchain

On December 20, 2022, Scapes moved fully onchain and renamed from "PunkScapes" to "Scapes on Ethereum". The artwork, metadata, and rendering logic are all stored in smart contracts. No external servers, no IPFS dependencies — Scapes will exist as long as Ethereum does.

## Trait Variations

As you collect Scapes, you'll notice that some traits have multiple variations. A sportscar might appear with or without a spoiler. A UFO might come equipped with a tractor beam. These hidden variations reward close attention and add depth to the collecting experience.

## Dates

Each of the 10,000 Scapes has a unique date embedded in its metadata, spanning from February 2, 2022 to 2049. These dates became the foundation for [Gallery Twenty Seven](/about/gallery-twenty-seven) — a 27-year daily art experiment.

## Marketplace

Scapes have a built-in marketplace integrated directly into the smart contract, similar to CryptoPunks. This allows peer-to-peer trading without relying on external platforms or requiring third-party approvals. The marketplace is open source and supports features like Only-on-Gains royalties.
