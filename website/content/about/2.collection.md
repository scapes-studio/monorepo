# The Collection

Scapes are 10,000 unique pixel landscapes on Ethereum. Each is algorithmically composed from 107 traits with multiple hidden variations, producing a wide range of environments — cities, forests, deserts, oceans, and everything in between.

## Onchain

On December 20, 2022, Scapes moved fully onchain. The artwork, metadata, and rendering logic are all stored in smart contracts. No external servers, no IPFS dependencies — Scapes will exist as long as Ethereum does.

## Trait Variations

As you collect Scapes, you'll notice that some traits have multiple variations. A sportscar might appear with or without a spoiler. A UFO might come equipped with a tractor beam. These hidden variations reward close attention and add depth to the collecting experience.

## Dates

Each of the 10,000 Scapes has a unique date embedded in its contract, spanning from February 2, 2022 to 2049. These dates became the foundation for [Gallery Twenty Seven](/about/gallery-twenty-seven) — a 27-year daily art experiment.

## Marketplace

Scapes have a built-in marketplace integrated directly into the smart contract, similar to CryptoPunks. This allows peer-to-peer trading without relying on external platforms or requiring third-party approvals. The marketplace is open source and supports features like Only-on-Gains royalties.

No marketplace fee is charged. The 5% creator royalties are split equally between the community fund and the team (2.5% each).
