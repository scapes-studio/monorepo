# Merges

Soon after release, community members started finding perfect scape pairs and combining them as diptychs into single images.

When it became clear that this adds another interesting collectible layer, we built tools to facilitate the process. The Scapes Discord bot supports merging up to 100 Scapes, combining them horizontally or vertically. It uses pattern matching to help find Scapes with compatible atmospheres, landscapes, and color palettes.

Merging is also available onchain, bringing the concept directly to the token level. The onchain contracts and Discord bots that make merging work were created by [0xAkuti](https://x.com/0xAkuti). Holders can combine Scapes to create larger, more complex compositions — building sprawling cityscapes, continuous coastlines, or layered environments from individual tiles.

## Fades

Scape Fades are a variation on merges that blend the edges of two Scapes together, allowing any pair to be combined seamlessly. Where standard merges require matching edges, fades open up the full combinatorial space of the collection.
