title: Chapter II
description: Transforming static pixels into interactive experiences
---

Chapter II introduced interactivity to Scapes. Beyond animating the pixel landscapes, it made them explorable — click, drag, type, and use arrow keys to pan through and experience each Scape with more depth.

Everything is code-based. The animations, camera movements, and roaming animals are all generated using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) by [Hearsay](https://x.com/hearsay_law). No pre-rendered video, no static frames — each Scape runs as a small interactive program.

This update created a more atmospheric feel for the collection. It proved especially effective at scale: during New York Fashion Week 2022, the interactive Scapes powered the set design for Vivienne Tam's main stage, generating an immersive, living backdrop.

From calming night scenes to racing a car across a landscape to watching a rocket launch into a meteor storm — Chapter II turned each Scape into a small explorable world.
