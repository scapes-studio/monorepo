# Archive

Instead of a basement under a headquarters, the Scapes Archive uses the Ethereum blockchain. It permanently documents the project's art and provenance — a lasting, verifiable record of each creation.

The blockchain storage also enables interoperability. Scapes art can be used in NFT galleries like Deca, where artists paint with Scape elements. The goal is to enable creativity and let the art spread organically.

Every archive piece is a 1-of-1, fully onchain, based on the [Archive Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x37292aec4bb789a3b35b736bb6f06cca69ebfa46).

## Collections

**Scape Elements** — All original Scape traits, archived individually.

**Branches by Scapes** — Branches and nests from the Scape Builder.

**Speech by Scapes** — Classic GM and other speech bubble designs.
