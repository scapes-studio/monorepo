# Archive

The Scapes Archive uses the Ethereum blockchain as a permanent place of storage. It permanently documents the project's individual artworks and provenance — a lasting, verifiable record of each creation.

The blockchain storage also enables interoperability. The artworks of individual traits can be used in NFT galleries like Deca, where artists paint with Scape elements. The goal is to enable creativity and let the art spread organically.

Every archive piece is a 1-of-1, fully onchain, based on the [Archive Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x37292aec4bb789a3b35b736bb6f06cca69ebfa46).
