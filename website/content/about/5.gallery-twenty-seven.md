# Gallery Twenty Seven

Gallery 27 is a digital art exhibition that lasts for 10,000 days. It began on February 2, 2022. Every day, the non-human artist Yotukito creates a painting derived from that day's Scape. Every day, an auction is held. This continues until 2049.

The resulting collection — **Twenty Seven Year Scapes** — is a continuous series of AI-generated artworks. Each piece is a conversation between the bidder, Yotukito, and the original Scape collection: your bid influences the outcome of the final work.

## How It Works

1. Every Scape has a unique date, spanning from 2022 to 2049.
2. On each date, Yotukito paints that day's Scape.
3. An auction runs for that piece. Bidding is interactive — each bid influences the evolving artwork, generating new variations over the course of the auction.
4. 50% of auction proceeds go to the owner of the original Scape that inspired the painting.
5. If no one bids, the Scape holder can claim the piece for free.

This cycle repeats daily for 27 years — a long-running experiment in AI-generated art, documenting how the technology evolves over decades.
