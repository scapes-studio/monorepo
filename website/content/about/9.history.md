# History

Scapes were first announced in July 2021. The project and its token were originally called **PunkScapes**, intended to serve as "10,000 homes for the CryptoPunks."

The community that formed around the project extended well beyond CryptoPunks holders, and the mission expanded accordingly — to become a home for all and to make Scapes the most composable NFTs around. This shift motivated the rebranding [from PunkScapes to Scapes](https://mirror.xyz/scapes.eth/ijC9vfEWbku06rR4jFGYP24V5_HabXhxgXpxVqBna1E).
