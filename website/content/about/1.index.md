description: An overview of the Scapes project — 10,000 unique pixel landscapes on Ethereum.
---

Scapes are 10,000 unique pixel landscapes created by [jalil.eth](https://x.com/jalilwahdat) and stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Each is algorithmically composed from 107 traits, forming a distinct place — from quiet hillsides to lit city skylines, from ocean shores to deep space.

Originally announced in July 2021 as **PunkScapes** — "10,000 homes for the CryptoPunks" — the project broadened its scope to become a home for all, leaning on composability with many different artworks.

Scapes are fully onchain. The artwork, metadata, and rendering logic all live in smart contracts — no external servers, no third party dependencies. They exist as long as Ethereum does.

Over the years, the project has grown into a series of interconnected experiments: [composable merges](/about/merges), [generative music](/about/scape-radio), [interactive animations](/about/chapter-two), a [27-year daily art exhibition](/about/gallery-twenty-seven), and an [onchain marketplace](/about/collection). Each layer builds on the original collection, treating the 10,000 pixel landscapes as a foundation for many creative experiments.
