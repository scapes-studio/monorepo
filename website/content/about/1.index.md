description: An overview of the Scapes project — 10,000 unique pixel landscapes on Ethereum.
---

Scapes are 10,000 unique pixel landscapes created by [jalil.eth](https://x.com/jalilwahdat) and stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Each is algorithmically composed from 107 traits, forming a distinct place — from quiet hillsides to lit city skylines, from ocean shores to deep space.

Originally announced in July 2021 as **PunkScapes** — "10,000 homes for the CryptoPunks" — the project broadened its scope to become a home for all, leaning on composability with many different artworks.

Scapes are fully onchain. The artwork, metadata, and rendering logic all live in smart contracts — no external servers, no third party dependencies. They exist as long as Ethereum does.

Over the years, the project has grown into a series of interconnected experiments: [composable merges](/about/merges), [generative music](/about/scape-radio), [interactive animations](/about/chapter-two), a [27-year daily art exhibition](/about/gallery-twenty-seven), and a built-in marketplace. Each layer builds on the original collection, treating the 10,000 pixel landscapes as a foundation for many creative experiments.

## Onchain

On December 20, 2022, Scapes moved fully onchain and renamed from "PunkScapes" to "Scapes on Ethereum". The artwork, metadata, and rendering logic are all stored in smart contracts. No external servers, no IPFS dependencies — Scapes will exist as long as Ethereum does.

## Trait Variations

As you collect Scapes, you'll notice that some traits have multiple variations. A sportscar might appear with or without a spoiler. A UFO might come equipped with a tractor beam. These hidden variations reward close attention and add depth to the collecting experience.

## Dates

Each of the 10,000 Scapes has a unique date embedded in its metadata, spanning from February 2, 2022 to 2049. These dates became the foundation for [Gallery Twenty Seven](/about/gallery-twenty-seven) — a 27-year daily art experiment.

## Marketplace

Scapes have a built-in marketplace integrated directly into the smart contract, similar to CryptoPunks. This allows peer-to-peer trading without relying on external platforms or requiring third-party approvals. The marketplace is open source and supports features like Only-on-Gains royalties.
